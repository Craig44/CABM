-------

:command:`find_package` uses ``PackageName_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.12 and above the ``find_package(PackageName)`` command now searches
a prefix specified by a ``PackageName_ROOT`` CMake or environment variable.
Package roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*``
commands inside find modules also search the roots as prefixes.  This policy
provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to avoid using
``PackageName_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``PackageName_ROOT``
variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``PackageName_ROOT``
variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
