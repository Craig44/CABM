# Individual Based Model (IBM)

This repository is for a generalised IBM that I am trying to generate during my PhD. It is a mixture of 
ideas that need to be acknowledged. Firstly to the Casal2 team found [here](https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/CASAL2),
which formulated the basis of the core code for error handling, parameter structure, configuration syntax and more. I also learnt about IBM's 
via the model found [here](https://github.com/trophia/sna1) where some idea's have been brought across.

This is an open source project and if anyone is interested in this project please get in touch the more input the better. Although there is a lot
code that has been pushed to the repository it is still in the design phase currently, have a look at this document for my current thoughts on code 
structure model design see this [document](https://github.com/Craig44/IBM/blob/master/initial%20thoughts.docx).

I am interested in adding features that are being used in recent applications of IBM's such as; [energetic functionality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018301327) 
habitat based movement, via currents and active gradient searches like in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661117302896)
Also make it a full life cycle model so that we can do (end to end model)[https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/science/article/pii/S0079661115000233]
It would also need to simulate data that could easily be assess in a stock assessment model for management strategy evaluation.
