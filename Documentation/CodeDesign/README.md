## This is a todo list

- ~~Create Cell Based derived Quantities~~
- ~~Link Derived Quantities to Recruitment Processes~~
- Figure out how to set scalars on agents when linking modeled number of agents to weight from the collective individuals
- Currently derived quantities wrap a mortality block following Casal2 formulations, I am thinking of pulling it out and creating it as a normal process? 
 This means that recruitment by definition has to follow a mortality block (because derived quantities are associated with mortality blocks), which seems like a shit limitation.
- Spatial mortality
- Spatial movement
