\section{Acknowledgements\label{sec:acknowledgements}}

We thank the developers of Casal2 \citep{CASAL2}, CASAL \citep{1388}, SNA1 agent based model (Jeremy McKenzie \& Nokome Bentley) and SPM \citep{SPM} for their ideas that led to the development of \IBM. 

Much of the structure of \IBM, equations, and documentation in this manual draw heavily on similar components of the fisheries population model Casal2 \citep{CASAL2}, CASAL \citep{1388} and  the spatial model SPM \citep{SPM}. We thank the authors of Casal2, CASAL and SPM for their permission to use their work as the basis for parts of \IBM\ and allow the use of the definitions, concepts, and documentation.
