\section{\I{The report section}\label{sec:report-section}}\index{Reports}\index{Reports section}
The report section specifies the printouts and other outputs from the model. \IBM\ does not, in general, produce any output unless requested by a valid \command{report} block. 

Reports from \IBM\ can be defined to print partition and states objects at a particular point in time, observation summaries, estimated parameters and objective function values. See below for a more extensive list of report types, and an example of an observation report.


\subsubsection{\I{Initialisation Partition}}
A very useful report for looking at the initialisation partition. This report prints too instances of the partition. The first is right after we do an exponential approximation in each cell, and the second is after we have run the initial annual cycle for \subcommand{years} and are about to enter the actual annual cycle.
