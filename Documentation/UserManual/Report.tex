\section{\I{The report section}\label{sec:report-section}}\index{Reports}\index{Reports section}
The report section specifies the printouts and other outputs from the model. \IBM\ does not, in general, produce any output unless requested by a valid \command{report} block. 

Reports from \IBM\ can be defined to print partition and states objects at a particular point in time, observation summaries, estimated parameters and objective function values. See below for a more extensive list of report types, and an example of an observation report.
