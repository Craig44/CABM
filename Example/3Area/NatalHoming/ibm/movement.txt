# A little experiment on how to move individuals around box's (Box transfer)
N = 1000000 ## number of individuals in cell 1
prob = c(0.333333,0.033333,0.6333333) ## probability of moving from cell 1 to all other cells including itself

  if( runif(1) < prob[possible_area]) {
    area_move[possible_area] = area_move[possible_area] + 1;
  }
  ## proposed implementation
  ndx = which(as.numeric(rmultinom(1,size = 1, prob)) > 0)
  area_move2[ndx] = area_move2[ndx] + 1;
}
## Current implementation
N - sum(area_move) ## individuals that didn't move add them to the cell they were in
area_move[1] = area_move[1] + N - sum(area_move)
area_move / sum(area_move)

## proposed implementation
N - sum(area_move2) ## no need to make an adjustment as they are all moved using the multinomial
area_move2 / sum(area_move2)
