Each example folder will have 3 additional folders within it,
-Casal2
-ibm
-R

Where `Casal2` has an equivalent model in at the population level written in the Casal2 format, you will need to download and install Casal2 if you want to run that
model. `ibm` has the configuration files for running the ibm, and the `R` folder will have functions and stuff to compare and look at output between the two 
platforms


- SteadyStateModel is a deterministic model run with a single area to check that everything works as expected
- SingleAreaVariability is a the same as SteadyStateModel but add variability in M and growth to look at consequences on equilibrium run time and derived quantities
